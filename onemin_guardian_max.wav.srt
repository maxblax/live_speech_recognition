00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,840
I've actually seen Gina McKee in real life once before, about 15 years ago.

2
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:12,000
On the YouTube, there were only three of us in the carriage.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:20,720
I whisper urgently, yet extremely quietly, to my 10-cent husband that Gina McKee, and

4
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:26,960
he boomed out in this huge man voice that is not Jillian McKee.

5
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:38,480
The gulf of a smile crossed her face, which was otherwise averted in palpable desire.

6
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:46,880
Not to get drawn in, so drew three conclusions, one of which I knew already, this actor has

7
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:50,360
an exquisitely readable face.

8
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:55,440
Her eyes can throw out a hundred distinct emotions a second.

9
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:03,160
She doesn't like the limelight, not at all, and I bet she's nice, happy to report having

10
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:20,760
met her properly on a hotel rooftop in London that I have once again completed right.
