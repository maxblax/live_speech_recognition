I've actually seen Gina McKee in real life once before, about 15 years ago.

00:07.840 --> 00:12.000
On the YouTube, there were only three of us in the carriage.

00:12.000 --> 00:20.720
I whisper urgently, yet extremely quietly, to my 10-cent husband that Gina McKee, and

00:20.720 --> 00:26.960
he boomed out in this huge man voice that is not Jillian McKee.

00:26.960 --> 00:38.480
The gulf of a smile crossed her face, which was otherwise averted in palpable desire.

00:38.480 --> 00:46.880
Not to get drawn in, so drew three conclusions, one of which I knew already, this actor has

00:46.880 --> 00:50.360
an exquisitely readable face.

00:50.360 --> 00:55.440
Her eyes can throw out a hundred distinct emotions a second.

00:55.440 --> 01:03.160
She doesn't like the limelight, not at all, and I bet she's nice, happy to report having

01:03.160 --> 01:20.760
met her properly on a hotel rooftop in London that I have once again completed right.
